## Overview

This domain provides methodological infrastructure for rigorous causal inference—tools that help researchers design studies, estimate treatment effects, and communicate uncertainty in ways that meet the standards of evidence-based practice.

### Planned Capabilities

**Research Design Tools**
- Power analysis with heterogeneous treatment effects
- Randomization inference frameworks
- Pre-analysis plan templates with versioning

**Causal Inference Pipelines**
- Modular estimators (IPW, AIPW, doubly robust)
- Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding
- Heterogeneous effects discovery and subgroup analysis

**Reproducibility Infrastructure**
- Automated audit trails from raw data to results
- Version-controlled analysis pipelines
- Replication package generation
