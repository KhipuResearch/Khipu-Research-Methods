## Overview

This meta-domain provides the infrastructure for coordinating multiple analytical frameworks—enabling research questions that span traditional disciplinary boundaries and require outputs from different modeling approaches to be combined coherently.

### Planned Capabilities

**Multi-Framework Orchestration**
- Workflow management for complex analytical pipelines
- Data handoff protocols between framework components
- Consistency checking across integrated outputs

**Cross-Domain Synthesis**
- Unified reporting across analytical domains
- Scenario comparison and sensitivity visualization
- Stakeholder-oriented output generation

**Governance and Validation**
- Audit trail infrastructure for complex analyses
- Version control for multi-component runs
- Reproducibility protocols for integrated workflows

## Relationship to Other Domains

The Integration & Orchestration frameworks serve as the coordination layer for all other KRL domains. As individual domain frameworks mature, this layer enables their combination for complex policy questions that cannot be addressed by any single analytical approach.
