## Overview

This meta-domain provides the infrastructure for coordinating multiple analytical frameworks—enabling research questions that span traditional disciplinary boundaries and require outputs from different modeling approaches to be combined coherently.

---

## Technical Approach

### Problems Addressed

- **Analytical silos** — Domain-specific models produce outputs that don't connect; policy questions that span boundaries go unanswered
- **Consistency failures** — Running separate models on the same scenario produces contradictory results without reconciliation
- **Workflow complexity** — Multi-stage analyses require manual data handoffs that introduce errors and break audit trails
- **Reproducibility gaps** — Complex pipelines are difficult to version, share, and replicate
- **Stakeholder translation** — Technical outputs need transformation for different audiences without losing fidelity

### Methodological Foundations

Our integration infrastructure builds on established workflow and modeling coordination approaches:

| Method | Application | Key References |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Input-Output Analysis** | Inter-industry linkages and multiplier effects | Leontief, Miller-Blair |
| **Soft-Linking** | Connecting models with different temporal/spatial resolution | Integrated assessment model coupling |
| **DAG Workflows** | Directed acyclic graph execution for complex pipelines | Airflow, Prefect paradigms |
| **Scenario Management** | Consistent parameter sets across model components | IPCC scenario protocols |
| **Uncertainty Propagation** | Monte Carlo and sensitivity across linked models | Global sensitivity analysis |

### Analysis Outputs

- **Integrated results** — Unified outputs combining multiple analytical domains
- **Consistency reports** — Cross-model validation and reconciliation diagnostics
- **Audit trails** — Complete provenance from inputs through all transformations to outputs
- **Scenario comparisons** — Side-by-side analysis under alternative assumptions
- **Stakeholder reports** — Audience-appropriate summaries with appropriate uncertainty communication

### Appropriate Applications

- Complex policy analyses spanning economic, social, and environmental domains
- Research programs requiring multiple methodological approaches
- Grant deliverables with multi-model requirements
- Regulatory analyses requiring documented reproducibility
- Strategic planning with scenario uncertainty
- Academic research on model integration methods

**Cross-Domain Synthesis**
- Unified reporting across analytical domains
- Scenario comparison and sensitivity visualization
- Stakeholder-oriented output generation

**Governance and Validation**
- Audit trail infrastructure for complex analyses
- Version control for multi-component runs
- Reproducibility protocols for integrated workflows

## Relationship to Other Domains

The Integration & Orchestration frameworks serve as the coordination layer for all other KRL domains. As individual domain frameworks mature, this layer enables their combination for complex policy questions that cannot be addressed by any single analytical approach.
