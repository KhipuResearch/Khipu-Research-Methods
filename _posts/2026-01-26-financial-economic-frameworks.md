## Overview

This domain addresses the intersection of financial systems and economic policy—tools for understanding how capital flows, risk dynamics, and market structures interact with community development and household welfare.

---

## Technical Approach

### Problems Addressed

- **Representative agent fiction** — Standard macro models assume identical households, missing how shocks affect different wealth levels differently
- **Regulatory fragmentation** — Basel, CECL, and stress testing requirements use different methodologies that don't integrate cleanly
- **Network blindness** — Bilateral exposure data is scarce; systemic risk assessment requires inference from partial information
- **Macro-financial disconnect** — Real economy models often ignore financial frictions; financial models ignore real economy feedback
- **Household heterogeneity** — Aggregate statistics obscure financial fragility concentrated in specific population segments

### Methodological Foundations

Our frameworks build on established financial and macroeconomic methods:

| Method | Application | Key References |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Basel III/IV** | Capital adequacy, liquidity coverage, leverage ratios | Basel Committee on Banking Supervision |
| **CECL** | Current expected credit loss provisioning | FASB ASC 326 |
| **CCAR/DFAST** | Supervisory stress testing scenarios | Federal Reserve stress testing methodology |
| **DSGE** | Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium with financial frictions | Smets-Wouters, Gertler-Karadi |
| **HANK** | Heterogeneous agent New Keynesian models | Kaplan, Moll, Violante (2018) |
| **Network Contagion** | Interbank exposure and cascade dynamics | Eisenberg-Noe clearing, DebtRank |
| **VaR/ES** | Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall | Basel market risk standards |

### Analysis Outputs

- **Risk metrics** — LCR, NSFR, capital ratios, VaR, Expected Shortfall with confidence bounds
- **Stress test results** — Capital depletion paths under adverse scenarios
- **Contagion maps** — Network visualization of systemic risk transmission
- **Macro projections** — GDP, inflation, employment under policy scenarios with heterogeneous household impacts
- **Distributional analysis** — Wealth and debt burden dynamics by household quintile
- **Regulatory compliance** — Structured outputs aligned with supervisory reporting requirements

### Appropriate Applications

- Bank regulatory compliance and internal risk assessment
- Macroprudential policy analysis
- Central bank research on monetary transmission
- Academic research on financial stability
- Household financial fragility assessment
- Community development financial institution (CDFI) analysis
- Grant applications for financial inclusion research

- Stress testing frameworks for policy scenarios
- Contagion modeling in financial networks

**Macroeconomic Modeling**

- Monetary-fiscal policy interaction analysis
- Open economy extensions for trade and capital flows

**Household Finance Analysis**
- Wealth distribution dynamics and mobility
- Debt burden and financial fragility indicators
- Access to credit and financial inclusion metrics
