This domain treats cultural dynamics as first-class variables in economic analysis—tools for measuring the economic contribution of creative industries, understanding how media shapes behavior and preferences, and quantifying cultural opportunity and access.

---

## Technical Approach

### Problems Addressed

- **Cultural externality treatment** — Standard economic models treat arts and culture as consumption residuals, missing their role in shaping preferences and behavior
- **Creative economy measurement** — GDP and employment statistics undercount creative occupations embedded across industries
- **Media influence opacity** — Information campaigns affect behavior, but effects are difficult to quantify with standard survey methods
- **Cultural access inequality** — Geographic and demographic disparities in cultural opportunity lack systematic measurement
- **Valuation challenges** — Intangible cultural assets resist standard financial valuation methods

### Methodological Foundations

Our frameworks integrate cultural economics with computational social science:

| Method | Application | Key References |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cultural Satellite Accounts** | Arts sector contribution to GDP | UNESCO Framework for Cultural Statistics |
| **CGE with Cultural Sectors** | General equilibrium with creative industry disaggregation | Applied general equilibrium methods |
| **Agent-Based Cultural Dynamics** | Preference evolution and social influence | Axelrod cultural dissemination models |
| **Media Reach Modeling** | Campaign exposure and behavioral response | Advertising effectiveness literature |
| **Cultural Opportunity Indices** | Access, participation, and infrastructure metrics | NEA Arts Participation Survey methodology |
| **IP Valuation** | Intellectual property and content lifecycle analysis | Real options and DCF approaches |

### Analysis Outputs

- **Contribution metrics** — Direct, indirect, and induced economic impact of cultural sectors
- **Behavioral simulations** — Agent-based projections of cultural trait evolution and media influence
- **Opportunity indices** — Cultural access scores by geography and demographic group
- **Equity decompositions** — Distributional analysis of cultural participation and investment
- **Valuation estimates** — Economic value of cultural assets, content portfolios, and IP

### Appropriate Applications

- Arts and culture economic impact studies
- Creative economy development planning
- Public interest media campaign design
- Cultural equity assessment and policy
- Foundation and NEA grant applications
- Museum, theater, and venue strategic planning
- Content and IP portfolio valuation
