## Overview

This domain treats cultural dynamics as first-class variables in economic analysis—tools for measuring the economic contribution of creative industries, understanding how media shapes behavior and preferences, and quantifying cultural opportunity and access.

### Planned Capabilities

**Cultural Economics Measurement**
- Economic contribution indices for arts and creative sectors
- Satellite account methodologies for cultural industries
- Employment and value-added analysis for creative occupations

**Media Influence Modeling**
- Information diffusion through social networks
- Attitude formation and preference dynamics
- Public interest communications impact assessment

**Cultural Opportunity Analysis**
- Access and participation indices by community
- Cultural infrastructure gap analysis
- Investment prioritization for creative economy development
