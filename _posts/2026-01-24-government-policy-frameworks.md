## Overview

This domain provides computational infrastructure for evidence-based policy analysis—tools that support regulatory impact assessment, program evaluation, and legislative analysis while meeting formal evidence requirements.

### Planned Capabilities

**Regulatory Impact Assessment**
- Cost-benefit analysis with equity weighting
- Distributional impact decomposition by demographic group
- Compliance burden estimation across affected populations

**Program Evaluation Infrastructure**
- Causal inference pipelines for treatment effect estimation
- Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, synthetic control
- Sensitivity analysis for identification assumptions

**Legislative Effect Estimation**
- Policy simulation for proposed legislation
- Revenue and expenditure projections
- Affected population identification and impact quantification
