## Overview

This domain provides computational infrastructure for evidence-based policy analysis—tools that support regulatory impact assessment, program evaluation, and legislative analysis while meeting formal evidence requirements.

---

## Technical Approach

### Problems Addressed

- **Scoring consistency** — Legislative proposals require standardized fiscal impact estimates across different analytical teams
- **Evidence mandate compliance** — GPRA, FFATA, and OMB requirements demand structured documentation of program outcomes
- **Distributional blindness** — Aggregate cost-benefit ratios obscure who bears costs and who receives benefits
- **Policy diffusion uncertainty** — State and local adoption patterns are difficult to forecast without systematic modeling
- **Interagency coordination** — Policies span jurisdictions; isolated agency analysis misses interaction effects

### Methodological Foundations

Our frameworks align with established government analytical standards:

| Method | Application | Alignment |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **CBO Scoring Methodology** | Budgetary impact estimation for legislation | Congressional Budget Office standards |
| **OMB Circular A-4** | Regulatory impact analysis with benefit-cost principles | Executive Order requirements |
| **GPRA Modernization Act** | Performance measurement and strategic planning | GAO evaluation standards |
| **Policy Diffusion Models** | State adoption patterns and spillover estimation | Berry & Berry event history approaches |
| **Spatial Econometrics** | Geographic spillovers and jurisdictional interaction | Anselin spatial regression methods |

### Analysis Outputs

- **Fiscal scores** — 10-year budget window projections with sensitivity ranges
- **Regulatory impact statements** — Structured cost-benefit documentation meeting OMB requirements
- **Performance metrics** — GPRA-aligned outcome indicators with baseline and target tracking
- **Distributional tables** — Impact breakdowns by income quintile, geography, and demographic group
- **Diffusion projections** — Expected adoption curves across jurisdictions under policy scenarios

### Appropriate Applications

- Legislative fiscal impact analysis
- Regulatory impact assessment (Executive Order 12866 compliance)
- Program evaluation and performance reporting
- Evidence Act and GPRA documentation
- Interagency policy coordination analysis
- State and local policy adoption forecasting
- Grant applications requiring policy impact evidence

## Planned Capabilities

**Regulatory Impact Assessment**
- Cost-benefit analysis with equity weighting
- Distributional impact decomposition by demographic group
- Compliance burden estimation across affected populations

**Program Evaluation Infrastructure**
- Causal inference pipelines for treatment effect estimation
- Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, synthetic control
- Sensitivity analysis for identification assumptions

**Legislative Effect Estimation**
- Policy simulation for proposed legislation
- Revenue and expenditure projections
- Affected population identification and impact quantification
