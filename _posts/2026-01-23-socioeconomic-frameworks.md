## Overview

This domain addresses foundational challenges in development economics and social measurement—how to quantify complex, multidimensional phenomena like poverty, human development, and inequality in ways that support both research rigor and policy relevance.

### Planned Capabilities

**Multidimensional Poverty Indices**
- Automated computation with demographic decomposition
- Alkire-Foster methodology implementation
- Spatial and temporal analysis across administrative units

**Human Development Indicators**
- SDG-aligned indicator computation and monitoring
- Inequality-adjusted metrics (IHDI, GDI, GII)
- Sub-national and intersectional disaggregation

**Integrated Assessment**
- Climate-equity integration for adaptation planning
- Cross-sector impact modeling (education, health, income)
- Long-horizon projection with explicit uncertainty bounds
