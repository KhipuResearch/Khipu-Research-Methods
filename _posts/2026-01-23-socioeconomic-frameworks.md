## Overview

This domain addresses foundational challenges in development economics and social measurement—how to quantify complex, multidimensional phenomena like poverty, human development, and inequality in ways that support both research rigor and policy relevance.

---

## Technical Approach

### Problems Addressed

- **Aggregation bias in poverty measurement** — Single-dimension metrics (income alone) miss deprivations that don't correlate with consumption
- **Within-group heterogeneity** — National averages obscure subnational and demographic variation that matters for targeting
- **Climate-development tradeoffs** — Sectoral policies interact across domains; isolated analysis produces misleading guidance
- **Temporal dynamics** — Static snapshots miss how households move in and out of deprivation over time

### Methodological Foundations

Our frameworks build on established, peer-reviewed methodologies:

| Method | Application | Key References |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Alkire-Foster** | Multidimensional poverty measurement with flexible cutoffs and decomposition | Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative |
| **UNDP Composite Indices** | HDI, IHDI, GDI, GII computation with inequality adjustment | UN Human Development Reports methodology |
| **Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)** | Economy-wide accounting linking production, income, and expenditure | IFPRI, World Bank GTAP |
| **Integrated Assessment Models** | Climate-economy interaction (DICE, GCAM-style approaches) | Nordhaus, JGCRI |
| **CGE-Microsimulation Linking** | Macro shocks traced to household-level welfare impacts | World Bank GIDD methodology |

### Analysis Outputs

- **Scalar indices** — MPI, HDI, SPI, and custom composite measures with confidence bounds
- **Decompositions** — By dimension, demographic group, administrative unit, and time period
- **Projections** — Forward scenarios under policy and climate assumptions
- **Contribution analysis** — Which deprivations drive aggregate poverty in each context
- **Targeting diagnostics** — Identification of high-priority populations and intervention points

### Appropriate Applications

- SDG monitoring and progress tracking
- National poverty assessment and strategy development
- Climate adaptation planning with equity considerations
- Program targeting and resource allocation
- Academic research on multidimensional welfare
- Grant proposals requiring rigorous measurement frameworks

## Planned Capabilities

**Multidimensional Poverty Indices**
- Automated computation with demographic decomposition
- Alkire-Foster methodology implementation
- Spatial and temporal analysis across administrative units

**Human Development Indicators**
- SDG-aligned indicator computation and monitoring
- Inequality-adjusted metrics (IHDI, GDI, GII)
- Sub-national and intersectional disaggregation

**Integrated Assessment**
- Climate-equity integration for adaptation planning
- Cross-sector impact modeling (education, health, income)
- Long-horizon projection with explicit uncertainty bounds
