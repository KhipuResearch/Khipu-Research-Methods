<h1>Evidence Infrastructure for Policy Analysis</h1>
</header>

<p class="lead">
Policy decisions demand evidence. Evidence requires infrastructure. We build that infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
The KRL Platform provides automated evidence infrastructure purpose-built for policy analysis. Unlike generic data science tools, every component is designed around the methodological rigor required for defensible policy conclusions—causal inference frameworks, equity-aware analytics, and complete audit trails.
</p>

<p>
The platform operates entirely server-side. No software installation. No database configuration. Analysts work through an intuitive interface—or Python SDK for programmatic access—with identical analytical capabilities either way.

<h2>Service Categories</h2>

<p>
The platform organizes capabilities into six analytical domains. Each domain addresses distinct policy questions and serves different stakeholder needs.
</p>

<!-- Impact Analysis -->
<h3 id="impact">Impact Analysis & Causal Evaluation</h3>

<p>
Determine whether a policy, program, or intervention actually caused observed outcomes—not merely correlated with them.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating whether a program achieved intended effects</li>
<li>Comparing policy outcomes across treatment and control regions</li>
<li>Constructing counterfactual scenarios for what would have happened absent intervention</li>
<li>Estimating treatment effects with defensible identification strategies</li>
<li>Meeting Evidence Act requirements for rigorous program evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Available methods include difference-in-differences, synthetic control, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, propensity score matching, double/debiased machine learning, and causal forests for heterogeneous effects. Full sensitivity analysis and robustness checks are built into every workflow.
</p>

<!-- Distributional -->
<h3 id="equity">Distributional & Equity Analysis</h3>

<p>
Identify which populations benefit, which bear costs, and whether outcomes vary systematically across demographic groups.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assessing differential policy impacts across income, race, geography, or other dimensions</li>
<li>Meeting executive order requirements for equity assessments</li>
<li>Targeting interventions to communities with greatest need</li>
<li>Measuring multidimensional poverty and deprivation</li>
<li>Understanding spatial clustering of disparities and opportunity gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>
Frameworks include Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), Human Development Index variants, inequality-adjusted measures, and spatial equity indices. Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation enables subgroup analysis within causal designs.
</p>

<!-- Economic Modeling -->
<h3 id="economic">Economic Modeling & Simulation</h3>

<p>
Project economy-wide effects, trace sectoral linkages, and simulate policy scenarios before implementation.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Estimating job creation, wage effects, or tax revenue implications of proposed policies</li>
<li>Tracing economic ripple effects through supply chains and industry sectors</li>
<li>Comparing alternative policy scenarios with consistent economic logic</li>
<li>Integrating climate, energy, and land-use considerations into economic projections</li>
<li>Supporting budget scoring and fiscal impact analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>
Available frameworks include Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, Social Accounting Matrices (SAM), Integrated Assessment Models (IAM), Input-Output analysis, and microsimulation integration for household-level projections.
</p>

<!-- Geographic -->
<h3 id="spatial">Geographic & Spatial Analysis</h3>

<p>
Understand how outcomes vary across space, identify spatial patterns, and account for geographic interdependence in statistical estimates.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mapping concentrations of need, opportunity, or risk across jurisdictions</li>
<li>Detecting spatial clustering and spillover effects between regions</li>
<li>Accounting for spatial autocorrelation in regression estimates</li>
<li>Identifying how effects vary geographically (local versus global patterns)</li>
<li>Integrating Census geometries and administrative boundaries into analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spatial econometric methods include spatial autoregressive models (SAR), spatial error models (SEM), spatial Durbin specifications, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Exploratory tools include Moran's I, LISA cluster detection, and Getis-Ord hotspot analysis.
</p>

<!-- Regulatory -->
<h3 id="regulatory">Regulatory & Program Performance</h3>

<p>
Score programs against statutory requirements, assess regulatory impacts, and track performance metrics aligned with federal guidance.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implementing Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act requirements</li>
<li>Producing CBO-style scoring or OMB PART-aligned assessments</li>
<li>Conducting regulatory impact analyses for rulemaking</li>
<li>Tracking GPRA Modernization Act performance indicators</li>
<li>Developing evidence-building plans and learning agendas</li>
</ul>

<p>
Government-aligned frameworks include CBO scoring patterns, OMB PART structures, GAO GPRA frameworks, regulatory impact analysis templates, and city/state resilience indices.
</p>

<!-- Financial -->
<h3 id="financial">Financial & Risk Analysis</h3>

<p>
Model credit, market, and systemic risks with regulatory-grade methods. Stress-test portfolios and institutions under adverse scenarios.
</p>

<h4>When to use this capability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assessing community lending, CDFI impact, or CRA compliance patterns</li>
<li>Stress-testing fiscal capacity under revenue shocks</li>
<li>Modeling liquidity and credit risk for public entities</li>
<li>Analyzing systemic risk propagation across interconnected institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Available frameworks include Basel III capital modeling, CECL credit loss estimation, stress testing scenarios, liquidity risk analysis, and networked financial contagion models.
</p>

<h2>Data Integration</h2>

<p>
Policy analysis fails at data integration more often than at modeling. Analysts spend the majority of project time locating, cleaning, and harmonizing data—before any analysis begins. The platform eliminates this bottleneck through pre-built connectors to authoritative sources.
