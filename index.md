This site serves as the source of truth for Khipu Research Labs (KRL) framework documentation. Each framework is
presented as an IMRAD-structured summary with downloadable full whitepapers.

The central concern is structural: how large-scale equilibrium models can be meaningfully extended to account for
heterogeneity, behavior, and institutional context without collapsing into narrative speculation or false precision.

Frameworks are released iteratively as validations proceed and assumptions are stress-tested. Click any tile below
to explore a framework's brief description, then download the complete technical documentation.
