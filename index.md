This site publishes a sequence of research papers and technical essays focused on the integration of economic modeling,
agent-based simulation, and cultural analysis.

The central concern is structural: how large-scale equilibrium models can be meaningfully extended to account for
heterogeneity, behavior, and institutional context without collapsing into narrative speculation or false precision.

New work is added over time. Older papers are revised, superseded, or explicitly bounded as assumptions change.
